## Vim 9

### Vim 9.1 is a release dedicated to Bram Moolenaar, who passed away on August 3, 2023.

I am a passionate software developer and open-source enthusiast with over a decade of deep involvement in the Vim community. I have a profound respect for Bram Moolenaar, the visionary lead developer of Vim for more than 30 years.

The adoption and promotion of Vim have often been hindered by its steep learning curve. To address this, I continue to develop plugins for Vim versions beyond vim91, using this commemorative username to honor the legacy and contribute to the community.
